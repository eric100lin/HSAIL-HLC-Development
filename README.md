LLVM-to-HSAIL-Test-Compiler-
============================

LLVM to HSAIL Test Compiler for early testing. 


07/29/2014 - Updated with latest D2 compiler to fix issues with C++AMP (MCW):

This D2 compiler update has the LLVM sources with D2 changes only. Please take llvm-3.2.src
or tar file and build using your native compiler.

You need to use the latest HSAIL-Tools-private for HSAIL tools with this compiler (which is 
1.0P compliant).

The existing binaries CLC2 could be used with this too.
